<h1 id="Name">Version 1.04</h1>
<div class="MainInfo">
<h2 id="Basics">Global Changes</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Arcade mode now has CPU opponents (though not every character has AI yet)</li>
  <li>The Red Dragon has been removed as the final boss of Arcade mode and replaced with a new one. There are also 2 hidden bosses if you finish a round with an Ultra enough times and don't lose once.</li>
  <li>Custom controls will now be saved, and are loaded upon starting the game.</li>
  <li>Custom music has been added. You can change the music for each stage and the main menu.</li>
  <li>Forward movement increased on rolls across the board.</li>
  <li>Rolls are now strike and projectile invincible, but can be thrown.</li>
  <li>Dodges are now strike and throw invincible, but vulnerable to projectiles.</li>
  <li>Crumples were altered. Characters will now stay upright when they are in a grounded state, and will topple to the ground when transitioning to an airborne state (the animation change remains true for airborne crumples as well).</li>
  <li>Light strength normal attacks will now force a reset on a juggled opponent (with a couple of exceptions).</li>
  <li>All throws will now toss the opponent forwards. If you hold in the opposite direction you are facing you will turn and throw them behind you instead.</li>
  <li>All moves that are not light attacks will now have guard crush potential. The amount of guard damage they do is generally based on the damage they do, but some moves will do more guard damage than their normal damage (such as Haggar's Pipe).</li>
  <li>Fixed moves that cause chip damage to also build Ultra meter.</li>
  <li>Moves that are fully invincible on start-up can no longer be X-cancelled and will not auto-correct.</li>
  <li>Just Defend will now give you a bit of life back and will restore a small portion of your guard meter (1/4th of the damage of the opponent's attack, rounded upwards). If the attack you Just Defend does chip, however, you will not gain life back but the chip damage will be nullified.</li>
  <li>Projectiles no longer freeze both players, and instead only freeze the defender. Exceptions being moves like Lucario's Aura Storm, or Blaziken's/Gardevoir's Hyper Beam. Hitstun and blockstun on projectiles has been altered to compensate for this.</li>
  <li>X-Counter input changed to forward + HP + HK during blockfreeze.</li>
  <li>Adjustments to certain characters frame data to match the data from the documentation.</li>
  <li>Parry window increased to 6 frames from 5.</li>
  <li>Low Parries will now only work against low attacks; Mid attacks can only be parried high.</li>
  <li>If you attempt to parry while you're in blockstun, the parry window is reduced to 2 frames.</li>
  <li>Just Defend window reduced to 7 frames from 8.</li>
  <li>Screen freeze when teching a throw reduced by 10 frames, recovery after teching a throw also reduced by 10 frames. Characters end closer to each other.</li>
  <li>Added random angles to the hitsparks.</li>
  <li>Added tech rolls. This is a universal mechanic and not tied to the selectable mechanics. If you tap down-forward or down-back upon landing (or hold forward or back and press the throw input) you will roll in that direction. Tech rolls are fully invincible, but are vulnerable to throws during the last 10 frames. Naturally, tech rolls do not work against hard knockdowns. You cannot perform a reversal after a tech roll.</li>
  <li>Added wake-up rolls. Hold forward or back to roll in that direction instead of getting straight up off the ground. This works with hard knockdowns as well. Wake-up rolls are fully invincible for most of it but are fully vulnerable at the end. You cannot perform a reversal after a wake-up roll.</li>
