Move Name: The name of the move.<br><br>
Command: What button inputs are required to perform the move.<br><br>
Move Type:

<table class="CharMoves">
  <tr>
    <th>Light</th>
    <td>The weakest attack strength. Almost all attacks of this type will force an air reset if it connects on an airborne opponent during a combo. Cannot be chained into unless the move can also be rapid fired.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Medium</th>
    <td>Stronger than light attacks, will not force an air reset if it hits an airborne opponent during a combo. Can be chained into from light attacks, or in certain cases, other Mediums.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Heavy</th>
    <td>Strongest normal attack type. Can be chained into from Mediums, but cannot chain into other Heavies (unless part of a target combo)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Special</th>
    <td>Usually performed with specific motions. All Special moves cause damage even if they're guarded. Can be cancelled into from any normal type if that move can be special cancelled. Some special moves also have EX versions which cost meter.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Super</th>
    <td>Similar to special moves, but usually are very high damaging. Costs meter. Can be cancelled into from normals or specials that are Super cancellable.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Ultra</th>
    <td>Very similar to Supers, but require Ultra meter instead of Super meter.</td>
  </tr>

<br>
Damage: How much damage the move causes.<br><br>
Stun: How much stun the move causes.<br><br>
Meter Gain (Whiff/Hit): How much meter the move builds. The first value is when the move is performed, the second value is when the move connects on hit. On block, you only gain 1/4th of that value.<br><br>
Start-up: How many frames it takes for the move to connect. A move with 4 frame start-up will take 4 frames to hit the opponent.<br><br>
Active: How many frames the attack can hit an opponent. Moves with values in parenthesis indicates a gap between hits. Numbers with values such as 2*2*2 means the move hits 3 times, and each individual hit lasts for 2 frames. Values such as 2x10 indicates a move that hits 10 times with each individual hit lasting for 2 frames.<br><br>
Recovery: How many frames after the final active frame the move takes to end. If it is followed by (land), that is how long you are stuck in recovery upon landing with moves that send you airborne.<br><br>
Advantage (On Hit): How many frames faster you recover than your opponent after hitting them. A positive number means you recover faster, a negative one means you recover slower. Also note that if your advantage is high enough, you can link into other moves; if it's low enough, you can be hit by an opponent's move before you are able to guard (a "punish"). So a move that is +5 on hit can combo into a move that is 5 frame start-up or less. A move that is -5 on hit can be punished by a move that is 5 frame start-up or less. (Note, the combo example is excluding the ability to cancel moves)<br><br>
Advantage (On Block): Similar to Advantage on hit, except it applies when the opponent guards the move.<br><br>
Juggle Potential: In this game, hitting an opponent in the air during a combo is known as a juggle combo. This adds numbers to an invisible counter (juggle points); once this counter hits a certain value, your moves may start to miss. If your move's juggle potential is equal to or higher than the juggle points of the opponent, you can still hit them.<br><br>
Juggle Cost: How much hitting an airborne opponent with this move adds to their juggle points.<br><br>
Hit Level: How you can guard a move. A move labeled "Mid" can be guarded standing or crouching. A move labeled "Low" can only be guarded crouching. A move labeled "Overhead" can only be guarded standing. "Unblockable" or "Throw" cannot be guarded at all (throws can be avoided by jumping).<br><br>
Cancel Ability: What move types the move can be cancelled into, if any.
<table class="CharMoves">
  <tr>
    <th>ch</th>
    <td>Can cancel into normal moves of a higher strength value (or in the case of Rapid Fire moves, into other light normals or itself).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>sp</th>
    <td>Can cancel into Special moves.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>su</th>
    <td>Can cancel into Super or Ultra moves.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>jmp</th>
    <td>Can be cancelled into a jump.</td>

Move Properties: There are various terms here to describe what a move can do.
<table class="CharMoves">
  <tr>
    <th><%= image_tag "info/rapidfire.png" %></th>
    <td>This move can be cancelled into itself or other light strength normals; most can also do this on whiff.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><%= image_tag "info/airok.png" %></th>
    <td>This move can also be performed in the air.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><%= image_tag "info/aironly.png" %></th>
    <td>This move can only be performed in the air.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><%= image_tag "info/dmgonblock.png" %></th>
    <td>This move causes damage even if the opponent guards. All Special and Super/Ultra moves cause this, so this label is only used for normals that have this property.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><%= image_tag "info/projectile.png" %></th>
    <td>This move is treated as a projectile.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><%= image_tag "info/reflect.png" %></th>
    <td>This move can reflect projectiles. Note, not all moves that are treated as projectiles can be reflected (and any projectile that hits multiple times cannot be reflected either)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><%= image_tag "info/stagger.png" %></th>
    <td>If you hit an opponent who is crouching with a move with this property, it will force them into a standing position.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><%= image_tag "info/launch.png" %></th>
    <td>A grounded opponent hit with this move will be sent airborne. Moves with this property also have the knockdown property.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><%= image_tag "info/knockdown.png" %></th>
    <td>If you hit an airborne opponent with this, they will be put into a juggleable state, instead of being air reset.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><%= image_tag "info/softknockdown.png" %></th>
    <td>Only a property with certain light strength normals. Light strength normals with this property will not cause an air reset during a juggle combo.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><%= image_tag "info/hardknockdown.png" %></th>
    <td>Similar to knockdown, except when the opponent hits the ground, they cannot quickstand or perform a tech roll.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><%= image_tag "info/crumple.png" %></th>
    <td>Moves with this property will cause a crumple state when they hit. Crumples are extended hit states that you can combo into anything from, even grabs. Crumples are considered grounded for the first 60 frames, then the opponent is put into an airborne state for another 30 frames before recovering.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><%= image_tag "info/groundbounce.png" %></th>
    <td>The move causes a ground bounce. This usually only applies to airborne opponents, but some moves with this property can cause a ground bounce on grounded opponents as well.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><%= image_tag "info/wallbounce.png" %></th>
    <td>The move will knock the opponent across the stage; when the opponent reaches the end of the screen, they will bounce off and come flying back towards you.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><%= image_tag "info/otg.png" %></th>
    <td>A move with this property can hit an opponent even if they're lying on the ground. Note, you can only hit an opponent with one OTG move per combo.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><%= image_tag "info/counter.png" %></th>
    <td>This is a special type of move. If your character is hit while a move of this type is active, you will perform a counter-attack if certain qualifications are met (some counters can only counter attacks that are overheads or mids, for example).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th><%= image_tag "info/capture.png" %></th>
    <td>If you hit an airborne opponent with this move (or an opponent that is lying down, if it has both a Capture and OTG property), it will force them into a grounded state. This also resets juggle points.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br><br>
Counter-hit Properties: Similar to move properties, but these only apply if the move hits as a counter-hit. +1/+3 Frame Advantage means that it gains that amount in frame advantage when it hits; this allows for new combos, in addition to the standard damage/stun boost.<br><br>
Other Notes: Anything else not covered by the other columns is covered here (such as invincibility).
